## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had quite a few challenges while working on this app. I originally tried my code from the previous version of this app, 
and something just wasn't working. I believe it was an unresolved variable issue, but I'm not sure where that variable would
have to have been placed. I tried using the provided starter code and everything went smoothly from there.
